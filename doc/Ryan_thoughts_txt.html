<p>player1 = “X” player2 = “O”</p>

<p>board = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]</p>

<p>visually this is the board :</p>

<p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</p>

<p>WINNING_COMBOS = array of arrays of winning combinations of squares</p>

<h1 id="label-5B">[<span><a href="#label-5B">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>

<pre> [0,1,2],
 [3,4,5],
 [6,7,8],
 [0,3,6],
 [1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [0,4,8],
 [6,4,2]
]</pre>

<p>turn : check which player is playing</p>

<p>player choice = prompt current player for choice</p>

<p>check if player choice is between “0” and board.length.to_s</p>
<ul><li>
<p>if it is not then “Invalid option” then ask for user choice again</p>
</li></ul>

<p>check if player choice is still inside the board for example  player1
choice = “4” (before first ever move)-&gt; board = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
-&gt; “4”.to_i is still in the board so: (after move) -&gt; board =
[0,1,2,3,“X”,5,6,7,8] -then player1&#39;s moves array = [4]</p>

<p>check then if player1 has won: check player1&#39;s current moves array
against each element (each is an array) of the winning_combos array. If all
of a particular combo&#39;s elements are present in player1&#39;s moves
array the player1 has won</p>

<p>for example (after many moves): player1&#39;s moves array = [4,2,7,6]
checking player1&#39;s moves array against “each” element of the
winning_combos array</p>

<pre>[0,1,2] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 2 is in moves
[3,4,5] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 4 is in moves
[6,7,8] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 6, 7 are in moves
[0,3,6] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 6 are in moves
[1,4,7] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 4,7 are in moves
[2,5,8] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; none are in moves
[0,4,8] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; only 4 are in moves
[6,4,2] vs [4,2,7,6] -&gt; *** 6,4,2 are all in moves!!!***</pre>

<p>current status of board array = [0,1,“X”,3,“X”,5,“X”,“X”,8] visually:</p>

<p>0 1 X 3 X 5 X X 8</p>

<p>visually it is evident that player1 has won!</p>

<p>if player1 has won then check_win will call game_over method</p>

<p>scenario2: if player1&#39;s moves don&#39;t make him win, example moves =
[4,2,7] board = [0,1,“X”,3,“X”,5,6,“X”,8] visually:</p>

<p>0 1 X 3 X 5 6 X 8</p>

<p>then check_win will check if board is completely occupied (no elements in
the array is a number) and if it is fully occupied and nobody has won then
will return that it&#39;s a tie..</p>

<p>then player1 turn will be off and player2&#39;s turn will be on</p>

<p>then the player2&#39;s turn logic will be the same as player1&#39;s</p>

<p>IF THIS LOGIC IS GOOD then:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><a href="Game.html">Game</a> will be main class (all other classes are
nested inside it)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>game will have a constant called</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p>WINNING_COMBOS =  [</p>

<pre> [0,1,2],
 [3,4,5],
 [6,7,8],
 [0,3,6],
 [1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [0,4,8],
 [6,4,2]
]

 - game will have game_start method
   - game_start will call create_player method
   - game will have an instance variable called @board = Board.new()
   - game start will call generate_board method

 - game will have generate_board method (which will always draw current status of board) based on current status of @board
    - generate_board(board) will loop from 0 to @board.board.length-1 and draw:
    if board[i].is_a? String then &quot;|_X_|&quot; or &quot;|_O_|&quot; depending on the character in that square
    else it will just puts &quot;|___|&quot;
    if @board.board.length % i == 0 then print an additional &quot;\n&quot;

 - game will have gameover method
   game_over method will just puts whoever wins or if it&#39;s a tie

 - game will have change_turns method

 - game will have check_win method
    - check_win will do the functionality described above
    - it will also check if all squares are occupied
    - if all squares are occupied and nobody has won then it will return that it&#39;s a tie
    - it will return 

 - game will have reset method
   - reset method will set players&#39; moves back to []
   - reset method will reassign @board = Board.new()
   - reset will then call again generate_board(player_1,player_2)

 - will have a class variable called @@players_count starting from 0

 - will have method called create_player which will instantiate Player class
    - each instantiation will += 1 to @@players_count
    - if @@players_count == 1 then instantiate players with Player.new(&quot;Player1&quot;, &quot;X&quot;)
    - if @@players_count == 2 then instantiate players with Player.new(&quot;Player2&quot;, &quot;O&quot;)
    - create_player will only be called if method game_start is called</pre>
<ol><li>
<p>Board class</p>
<ul><li>
<p>board will have @board as instance variable (array of numbers) and will be

<p><a href="Player.html">Player</a> class -&gt; this will have a method called
turn (whose logic is described above)</p>

<pre>- each player will have an instance variable called @name and it will be either &quot;Player1&quot; or &quot;Player2&quot;
- each player will have instance variable @sign and it will be &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; depending if Player1 or Player2
- player class will have moves array (array of numbers representing squares player has occupied)
- turn method will be as described above</pre>

<p><a href="Player.html">Player</a> class will have two subclasses -&gt;
Human, Computer -&gt; the Computer class will override the turn method (the
only difference is that the Computer&#39;s choice is random)</p>
